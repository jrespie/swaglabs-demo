## The exercise
**Goal:**
The goal of this exercise is to complete the two incomplete tests in `login.spec.js`

**Stretch goal:**

Modify the tests by adding a login function to `commands.js`, and call this function instead of your repeated login code

**Another stretch goal:**
Modify the tests so that the login credentials are not hardcoded into the tests.
